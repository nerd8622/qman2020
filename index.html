			<h1>The Story Of Q-Man</h1>
			<div class="maintext">
			<p>Q-Man stated that he <strong>"wanted to make the world a better place"</strong>. Anyone who had the privilege of meeting him knows that he accomplished this. While a student at Highlands Ranch High School, Q participated in cross country and wrestling. He was known around school for being friends with everyone and his contagious positive attitude. The purpose of the Q-Man Classic was to preserve his legacy and continue to make the world a better place, just as Q would want.</p>
